1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? 
Block Elements are those that take up the full width available on a web page, effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right.
Inline Elements are those who only take up as much width as is needed to display the contents of the element, thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline element.
